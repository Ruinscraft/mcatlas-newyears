# mcatlas-newyears

Used for New Years celebration on MCAtlas. When a town in its respective time zone enters the new year, fireworks are created, and gold is dropped for those towns and players in the time zone. There were issues with this when used in production (Pacific Time did not register at all for some reason), but otherwise everything functioned smoothly.

You're completely free to use this, though make sure to follow necessary Towny licensing/guidelines.
